### Sentimental Analysis Using BERT
[Publication](https://medium.com/@karteekmenda93/part-1-sentimental-analysis-using-bert-c030ca9b33b6)


Sentiment analysis is the interpretation and classification of emotions (positive, negative and neutral) within text data using text analysis techniques. Sentiment analysis tools allow businesses to identify customer sentiment toward products, brands or services in online feedback. **Blogged** about the architecture of **Transfromers** (Attention is all you need) **Encoder and Decoder** Blocks, **BERT : Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers** and detailed how the **BERT** architecture helps in finding the **Sentiments**.

### OCR â€” Optical Character Recognition
[Publication](https://medium.com/@karteekmenda93/ocr-optical-character-recognition-f4317300fa8f)


**Optical Character Recognition(OCR)** is the technology for automatic text recognition. We can translate printed, handwritten and scanned documents into a machine readable format. This technology relieves employees of manual entry of data, and reduce human errors. **Blogged** about the document recognition, **NLP**, coupled with **OCR**, finds applications for data retrieval, information extraction, with an example of a sample image. We can extract everything of value for a company(information about consumers, payment data from invoices) from top to bottom in a document. Also, demonstarted the usage of **Google transaltor** to translate the extracted text. Later used **Google text to speech converter** where the text is been converted to the language we specify over there. So, this can serve someone who are visual impaired.

### A Beginnerâ€™s Guide to NLP
[Publication](https://medium.com/@karteekmenda93/a-beginners-guide-to-nlp-da13fae5e885)


In this blog, I detailed some of the **NLP tasks** and built a web aplication using **Streamlit**. The **NLP tasks** are mentioned below
- **Tokenization** and **Lemmatization** of the text
- **NER(Named Entity Recognition)** from the text
- **Sentimental Analysis**
- **Text Summarization** (Extract Summarization)
- **Machine Translation**

### Deployment of Machine Learning Application Made Easy
[Publication](https://medium.com/@karteekmenda93/deployment-of-machine-learning-application-made-easy-f61ba593c318)


**ML application development** is really fun and these apps help data scientists and machine learning engineers to solve business problems. In this blog, I have taken the **Prediction of the Customer Churn** as the objective, and developed a ML model to do it. Later, the model is been pickled and a **web application** is built using the Streamlit. The basic moto of this blog is to show how we can **deploy our ML application** onto the web very easily.

### Exploratory Data Analysis Tools
[Publication](https://medium.com/@karteekmenda93/exploratory-data-analysis-tools-83ef538c879f)


**Exploratory Data Analysis** is an approach to analyzing data sets to summarize their main characteristics, often with visual methods. It is a good practice to understand the data first and try to gather as many insights from it. **EDA** is all about making sense of data in hand, before getting them dirty with it. In this blog, I tried to explain some of the tools like(**Pandas-Profiling**, **Sweetviz**, **D-Tale**), which helps us in doing **Auto EDA**.
